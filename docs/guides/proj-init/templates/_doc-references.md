# Document References (shared partial)

This block is the **single source** for the cross-document reference map. The
runner injects it into every generated proj-init document by replacing the
`<!-- @inject: _doc-references.md -->` marker with the content between the
`BEGIN INJECT` / `END INJECT` markers below. Edit the table here only — never
copy it into a template or a generated document.

The proj-init document set is fixed at seven docs. Adding, removing, or renaming
a document is a deliberate change made here, and it propagates to every doc on
the next generation.
