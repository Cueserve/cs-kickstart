## 1. System Architecture

[High-level breakdown of components, modules, or services and how they connect.
At least one diagram is required — a fenced text diagram is acceptable; a
whitebox or sequence diagram is preferred.]

```text
[diagram — components and how they connect]
```

- [Component] — [its responsibility]

## 2. Data Design

[Core entities, schema/storage layout, and how data is structured.]

## 3. Data Flow & Interactions

[How data moves between components and external systems.]

## 4. Key Design Decisions

[Structural choices — layering, sync vs async, service boundaries — each with
rationale. Technology selection lives in TECH-STACK.md.]

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [the decision point] | [what was chosen] | [why — what it buys, what it trades] |

## 5. Implementation Conventions

[Patterns, standards, and structural rules developers must follow — how to
build, not the code itself.]

- [Convention] — [what it requires]

## 6. Integration Points

[How the system connects with external APIs, services, or dependencies.]

- [Integration] — [protocol/contract and direction]

## 7. Security Posture & Data Classification

[Data sensitivity (public / internal / confidential / restricted); auth and
authorization model; encryption at rest and in transit; trust boundaries and
network exposure; compliance requirements from PRD.md and how the architecture
satisfies them; known threat vectors the design accounts for.]

| Data category | Classification | Handling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [data type] | [public / internal / confidential / restricted] | [how it is protected] |

## 8. Non-Functional Approach

[How the remaining PRD.md non-functional requirements — scale, performance,
availability, resilience — are met structurally.]
