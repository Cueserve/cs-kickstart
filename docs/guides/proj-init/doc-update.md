# Project Initiation Document Update

Use this any time reality diverges from one of the initiation documents. Pass the document name inline (e.g. `/proj-init-doc-update PRD.md`) or run `/proj-init-doc-update` and be asked.

## Resolve the target

Read `.proj-init/state.json` from this kit root and set `TARGET` to its `targetFolder`. If it is missing, print `No initiation workspace found. Run Step-00 (/proj-init-bootstrap) first.` and stop. Every git command, host CLI, and file path below is relative to `$TARGET` (run git as `git -C "$TARGET" …`, host CLIs from within `$TARGET`, and read/write documents under `$TARGET/`).

## Supported documents and their review gates

| Document | Reviewer gate |
| -------- | ------------- |
| `PRODUCT.md` | Product Owner |
| `PRD.md` | Product Owner |
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | Architect + Product Owner |
| `TECH-STACK.md` | Architect |
| `AI-TOOL-GUIDE.md` | Architect |
| `README.md` | Architect |
| `BACKLOG.md` | Product Owner |

## Resolve the document path

The argument is the bare document name (e.g. `PRD.md`). Resolve it to its repo path before running any git command: the six content docs live under `docs/` — `docs/PRODUCT.md`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/TECH-STACK.md`, `docs/AI-TOOL-GUIDE.md`, `docs/BACKLOG.md`; `README.md` is at the repo root. Use the resolved path everywhere `<DOCNAME>` appears below (e.g. `git -C "$TARGET" show main:docs/PRD.md`). The `docs/update/<docname>` branch and the reconciliation-file slug still use the bare name (e.g. `docs/update/prd`, `prd-reconcile.md`).

## 1. Identify the document and the change

- **If a document name was passed as an argument** (e.g. `/proj-init-doc-update PRD.md`): use it. Validate it is in the supported list above — if not, tell the user and stop.
- **If no argument was given**: ask which document needs updating.

Then ask one question: *What changed?* (one or two sentences is enough.) Do not ask for more detail yet.

## 2. Preconditions — run before anything else

1. **Document exists on `main`** — run `git -C "$TARGET" show main:<DOCNAME>`.
   - Exit 0 → proceed.
   - Non-zero → **STOP.** Tell the user: "That document is not on `main` yet — complete initiation first."

2. **Clean working tree** — run `git -C "$TARGET" status --porcelain`.
   - Empty output → proceed.
   - Non-empty → **STOP.** Tell the user: "Uncommitted changes detected in the target — commit or stash first."

## 3. Create the working branch

In the target, branch off `main`: `git -C "$TARGET" checkout -b docs/update/<docname>` (e.g. `docs/update/prd`).

If that branch already exists, ask the user whether to reuse it or create a new one. Do not reuse silently.

## 4. Make the update

- Read the current document from disk.
- Based on what the user described, identify which section(s) need to change. Ask one follow-up question only if a section is ambiguous — do not run a full re-interview.
- Update only the affected sections. Do not rewrite content that was not mentioned.
- Show only the changed sections as a before/after diff. Wait for the user to confirm before writing.
- Write the file.

## 5. Run the impact analyzer and create a reconciliation checklist

This step is **required** — do not skip it.

### Impact analyzer

Using the dependency map below, identify all downstream documents. Mark each as:

- `required-update` — must be reviewed and updated
- `review-only` — validate that no update is needed
- `not-impacted`

Use the user's stated change and the edited sections to justify each mark in one short line.

Dependency map:

| Updated doc | Downstream documents |
| ----------- | -------------------- |
| `PRODUCT.md` | `PRD.md` → `ARCHITECTURE.md` → `TECH-STACK.md` → `AI-TOOL-GUIDE.md` → `README.md` → `BACKLOG.md` |
| `PRD.md` | `ARCHITECTURE.md` → `TECH-STACK.md` → `AI-TOOL-GUIDE.md` → `BACKLOG.md` |
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | `TECH-STACK.md` → `AI-TOOL-GUIDE.md` |
| `TECH-STACK.md` | `AI-TOOL-GUIDE.md` |
| `AI-TOOL-GUIDE.md` | *(none — end of chain)* |
| `README.md` | *(none — end of chain)* |
| `BACKLOG.md` | *(none — end of chain)* |

### Create the reconciliation checklist file

Write `$TARGET/.claude/reconciliation/<docname>-reconcile.md` with:

```markdown
# Reconciliation: <DOCNAME> — <date>

**Change summary:** <one-line description of what changed>
**Branch:** docs/update/<docname>
**PR/MR:** <link once opened>

## Downstream checklist

- [ ] `<DOC>` — <required-update | review-only>: <one-line justification>
      Next action: run `/proj-init-doc-update <DOC>` if update is required.
- [ ] `<DOC>` — ...

## Completed
<!-- Move items here once resolved -->
```

Include the checklist file in the same commit as the document update.

## 6. Commit

In the target, commit the updated file and the reconciliation checklist with:
`git -C "$TARGET" commit` and message `docs: update <DOCNAME> — <one-line summary of what changed>`

Never commit to `main`.

## 7. Open the PR/MR (requires explicit confirmation)

Ask the user to confirm before pushing. On confirmation:

- Push the branch (`git -C "$TARGET" push -u origin docs/update/<docname>`) and open a PR/MR targeting `main` using the host CLI run from within `$TARGET`.
- Title: `docs: update <DOCNAME> — <one-line summary>`
- Body: what changed, why, which downstream documents are flagged, path to `$TARGET/.claude/reconciliation/<docname>-reconcile.md`, and the reviewer checklist from the document's step guide (`docs/guides/proj-init/` in this kit).
- Reviewer: same gate as the original initiation step (see the table in Section 1).

Remind the user: the document is only updated once the PR/MR is merged to `main`. Work through the reconciliation checklist afterward — one `/proj-init-doc-update <doc>` per flagged downstream document.
